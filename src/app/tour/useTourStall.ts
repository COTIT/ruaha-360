/**
 * A tour that is running but drawing nothing has stopped being a tour.
 *
 * This is the backstop, and it exists because the library has more ways to
 * stall than are worth enumerating. The one that reached users: the overlay is
 * a full-screen `<path fill="var(--scrim)">` with `pointer-events: auto`, and
 * it renders for lifecycles the TOOLTIP does not — so any stall leaves a navy
 * sheet over the page swallowing every click, with nothing left to explain it.
 * Reported from the demo as "the screen stays blue and I cannot click
 * anything", on desktop and mobile, escapable only by reloading into it again.
 *
 * Two stalls were found in one afternoon: in controlled mode the library never
 * sets `finished` by itself, and on a production build it began scrolling to a
 * stop, never reported finishing, and never drew. Rather than keep naming
 * them, this watches the only thing that actually matters — whether a bubble
 * is on the screen — and ends the tour when one has not been for `ms`.
 *
 * A `MutationObserver` rather than polling, and the timer restarts only on the
 * edge into absence, so an ordinary screen change (a second or so with no
 * bubble) costs nothing.
