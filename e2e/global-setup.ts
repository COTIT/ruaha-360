 * Deliberately NOT warming the dev server. That was tried for QA #33 and the
 * measurement disproved the theory behind it: a cold first load is 1,386ms
 * against 325ms warm, so Vite's on-demand compile costs about a second — no
 * part of a ten-second timeout. The real cause was a transient auth failure,
 * fixed in `sessionQuery`.
