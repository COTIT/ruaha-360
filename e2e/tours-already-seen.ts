/**
 * Every seeded user has already taken every tour, as far as the suite is
 * concerned.
 *
 * The guided tour runs itself once per user per surface on a first visit, and
 * a Playwright context is always a first visit: without this, a full-screen
 * overlay would open on top of all 173 tests and every click would land on the
 * scrim instead of the app.
 *
 * Written as real storage rather than a test-only escape hatch in the app: the
 * app has no "suppress tours" flag to reach for, and giving it one would put a
 * branch in shipped code that exists only for the suite. `tour.spec.ts` opts
 * out of this state to test the tour itself.
